# BMI-Calculator
Simple BMI Calculator

This is a simple BMI Calculator that asks the users name, their weight, and height. From the height and weight input, 
the program then computes the users BMI. The BMI is calculated in standard verion (metric to come soon). The numbers are 
based on the general BMI standard values. 

Note: THis is a practice programming project and should not be used to help determine BMI for a healthy lifestyle.
